## About This Project

[View the Spootify Coding Challenge!](https://github.com/alexgurr/react-coding-challenges/tree/master/spootify)

There are two sections to this project.

- The web app
- The node server

This uses Spotify's [Client Credentials Flow](https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/general/guides/authorization-guide/#client-credentials-flow) which is meant to happen server side in order to avoid exposing the user's `client_secret`. All requests to the Spotify API are authenticated with a Bearer token from this local node API.

Normally the request to fetch the Bearer token would happen when the user logs in, but based on [the Spootify Code Challenge docs](https://github.com/alexgurr/react-coding-challenges/tree/master/spootify) creating a user login flow was not part of this challenge.

[Check out the Spotify docs](https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/general/guides/app-settings/) for details about generating a `client_id` and `client_secret`
